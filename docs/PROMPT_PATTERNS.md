# Prompt Patterns for AI-Assisted Template Creation

Learn how to structure effective prompts for generating visual style templates with AI.

## Basic Prompt Structure

Effective prompts follow a simple pattern:

```
[Style] + [Colors] + [Fonts] + [Mood/Tone]
```

### Simple Prompts (One-liners)

Best for quick generation when you have a clear vision:

"light minimalist design with pastel colors"
"bold vibrant colors, tech startup style"
"corporate blue and gray, professional"
```

**When to use:** Quick iterations, clear style preferences, simple use cases

### Detailed Prompts (Multi-element)

Best for specific requirements or when you want more control:

```
"dark professional theme with blue accents, modern sans-serif font, 
clean and minimalist, high contrast"

"light minimalist design with pastel colors, elegant serif typography, 
spacious and airy, soft shadows"

"bold vibrant colors, tech startup style, clean sans-serif, modern and 
energetic, high contrast for impact"

## What Works Well

✅ **Specific colors**: "blue and gray" vs "some colors"  
✅ **Font style mentioned**: "sans-serif" vs "nice fonts"  
✅ **Mood/tone included**: "professional" vs "good"  
✅ **Style references**: "Apple-style", "Material Design"  
✅ **Clear style description**: "minimalist" vs "clean looking"

## What to Avoid

❌ **Too vague**: "make it look good"  
❌ **Conflicting terms**: "minimalist but busy"  
❌ **Over-technical**: "use rgba(0, 122, 255, 0.3) for shadows"  
❌ **Brand names**: "use Apple's exact colors" (use style descriptions instead)  
❌ **Too many requirements**: Keep it focused

## Iteration Strategy

1. **Start simple**: Begin with a basic prompt
2. **Generate template**: See what you get
3. **Refine**: Add specific elements based on results
4. **Iterate**: Keep refining until you're happy

**Example Iteration:**
```
Iteration 1: "dark theme"
Iteration 2: "dark professional theme"
Iteration 3: "dark professional theme with blue accents"
Iteration 4: "dark professional theme with blue accents, modern sans-serif"
```
