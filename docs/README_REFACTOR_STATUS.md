# README Refactor Status

## Overall Progress: **~60% Complete** (Phases 1-3 Complete, Phases 4-6 In Progress)

Phases 1-3 have been implemented. The README now follows a more user-focused structure with Quick Start at the top, Core Concepts, and Common Use Cases.

## Current State vs. Plan

### ✅ What Exists (But Needs Reorganization)

- **Quick Start section** exists but comes after AI features (should be first)
- **Diagram Types** section exists with examples (needs decision tree)
- **Examples** section exists (needs showcase integration)
- **API Reference** exists (needs separation from learning content)
- **Showcase examples** are generated and referenced

### ❌ What's Missing (Per Plan)

- **Introduction & Quick Start** at the top (5-minute path)
- **Core Concepts** section (progressive learning)
- **Common Use Cases** section (practical patterns)
- **Decision tree** for diagram types
- **Reorganized advanced topics** (moved later)
- **Simplified installation** (minimal upfront)

## Implementation Checklist Status

### Phase 1: Introduction & Quick Start
- [x] Add "What is this?" section
- [x] Simplify installation (minimal steps)
- [x] Create copy-paste first example
- [x] Add "What you learned" summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Phase 2: Core Concepts
- [x] The Generator (what, why, how)
- [x] Diagram Types overview with gallery
- [x] Templates introduction
- [x] Attribution introduction

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Phase 3: Common Use Cases
- [x] Quick graphics
- [x] Custom styling
- [x] Batch generation
- [x] Export options

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Phase 4: Diagram Types Guide
- [ ] Add decision tree
- [ ] Create visual gallery
- [ ] Add "when to use" for each type
- [ ] Make scannable

**Status**: Partially done (has examples, missing decision tree)

### Phase 5: Advanced Topics
- [x] Move custom templates to advanced
- [x] Move custom diagrams to advanced
- [x] Move AI features to advanced
- [x] Move attribution system to advanced
- [x] Add "when you need this" context

**Status**: ✅ Complete (all advanced topics now under Advanced Topics section)

### Phase 6: Reference Sections
- [x] Separate API reference (under Reference Sections)
- [x] Enhance examples section (organized under Reference Sections)
- [x] Improve troubleshooting (organized under Reference Sections)

**Status**: ✅ Complete (all reference sections organized under "Reference Sections")

### Phase 7: Polish & Test
- [ ] Review for clarity
- [ ] Test all code examples
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Get feedback from new users

**Status**: Not started

## Current README Structure (Old)

1. Features
2. Installation (detailed, includes AI)
3. Configuration (detailed)
4. AI-Assisted Template Creation (very early)
5. Quick Start (after AI features)
6. Multiple Diagram Examples
7. Command Line Interface
8. Attribution System
9. Custom Templates
10. Custom Diagram Types
11. Diagram Types (detailed)
12. API Reference
13. Export Options
14. Examples
15. Development
16. Architecture
17. License
18. Troubleshooting

## Target README Structure (New)

1. **Introduction & Quick Start** (5 min to first graphic)
2. **Core Concepts** (10 min to understanding)
3. **Common Use Cases** (15 min to practical usage)
4. **Diagram Types Guide** (reference with decision tree)
5. **Advanced Topics** (learn as needed)
6. **Reference Sections** (complete docs)

## Next Steps

To implement the refactor:

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Rewrite the introduction and quick start
   - Move Quick Start to the top
   - Simplify installation
   - Add copy-paste example
   - Add "what you learned"

2. **Then Phase 2**: Create Core Concepts section
   - Extract and reorganize existing content
   - Add visual gallery
   - Simplify explanations

3. **Continue sequentially** through phases

## Notes

- The plan is comprehensive and ready to implement
- Current README has all the content, just needs reorganization
- Showcase examples are already generated and can be used
- Focus should be on user journey, not feature completeness upfront
