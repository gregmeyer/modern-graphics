# Prompts Used in Examples

This document lists all the prompts being used in the use case examples. These prompts demonstrate the prompt-based approach for generating story slides with visualization heroes.

## Tech Startup Use Case

### 1. Product Vision Story Slide
```
Show how our AI platform transforms manual business processes into automated intelligence.
The transformation happened rapidly from 2024 to 2025, with efficiency improvements increasing from 1x baseline to 10x efficiency.
This represents a fundamental shift in how businesses operate, enabling teams to focus on strategic work instead of repetitive tasks.
Include metrics showing: processing time reduced from 8 hours to 45 minutes, accuracy improved from 85% to 99.5%, and cost savings of $2M annually.
```

### 2. Revenue vs User Growth Combo Chart
```
Show the correlation between user growth and revenue growth using a dual-axis combo chart.
User base grew from 1,000 in Q1 2024 to 8,000 in Q4 2024, representing 700% growth.
Simultaneously, revenue increased from $50K in Q1 to $120K in Q4, showing strong monetization.
The correlation demonstrates that as we acquire more users, revenue scales proportionally.
Visualize both metrics on a combo chart: user growth as a line (left axis) and revenue as bars (right axis).

Completion rates improved from 60% in 2023 to 78% in 2024, showing the effectiveness of our new curriculum.
Average student satisfaction scores increased from 4.2/5 to 4.7/5, indicating better learning outcomes.
Visualize the learning journey with metrics: 78% completion rate, 85% skill mastery, 4.7/5 satisfaction, and 92% job placement rate.
```

## Healthcare Use Case

### 1. Research Findings Story Slide
```
Present our clinical research findings showing improved treatment outcomes with the new protocol.
Patient recovery rates improved from 60% with traditional treatment to 85% with the new protocol over the 2022-2024 study period.
Recovery time decreased from 6 months to 3 months on average, significantly improving patient quality of life.
Treatment costs reduced by 30% while outcomes improved, demonstrating both clinical and economic benefits.
Show the correlation between treatment protocol adoption and patient outcomes with key metrics: 85% success rate, 3-month recovery time, 30% cost reduction, and 92% patient satisfaction.
```

## Creative Use Case

### 1. Portfolio Growth Story Slide
```
Show the evolution of my creative portfolio and client impact over the past three years.
Client projects increased from 12 in 2022 to 35 in 2024, representing 192% growth in creative output.

```

## Story Slide Examples

### 1. Ocean Temperature Rise (Single Chart)
```
Show how ocean temperatures have risen dramatically over the past decade.
The data shows a steady increase from 2014 to 2024, with temperatures rising from 20°C to 24°C.
This represents a critical climate change indicator that affects marine ecosystems globally.
```

### 2. Ocean Heat vs Extreme Weather (Combo Chart)
```
Visualize the correlation between ocean heat content and extreme weather events.
Ocean heat has increased from 100 zettajoules in 2010 to 180 zettajoules in 2024.
Simultaneously, extreme weather events have increased from 50 events per year to 120 events per year.
Show both metrics on a dual-axis combo chart to demonstrate the correlation.
```

## Prompt Best Practices

Good prompts for story slides should:
1. **Describe the data/story clearly** - What is being visualized?
2. **Include specific metrics and numbers** - Concrete data points
3. **Mention time periods and trends** - When did this happen?
4. **Request visualization type** - Single chart or combo chart?
5. **Include context** - What does this mean? Why does it matter?

## Prompt Structure

Effective prompts follow this structure:
- **Opening**: What story/data are we showing?
- **Data points**: Specific numbers, metrics, time periods
- **Trend/Change**: What changed? What's the pattern?
- **Significance**: What does this mean? Why is it important?
- **Visualization request**: What type of chart? (optional but helpful)
